Of course. Here is a complete Python script designed for Google Colab that sets up an AI image art generator. This code allows you to fuse two images based on a text prompt and generates a new image in a 9:16 aspect ratio with a full-body view.

Just copy and paste each code block into a separate cell in your Google Colab notebook and run them in order.

-----

## 1\. Setup Environment ‚öôÔ∏è

This first step installs all the necessary libraries. It might take a few minutes to complete.

# Install required Python libraries
!pip install diffusers transformers accelerate invisible_watermark -q

-----

## 2\. Load the AI Model üß†

Next, we'll load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is powerful and can create high-quality images. This step downloads the model weights, so it can also take a moment.

import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline
from PIL import Image
import requests
from io import BytesIO

# Load the pre-trained image-to-image pipeline
# Using a specific model known for good artistic results
model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipe = StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    use_safetensors=True
)



print("‚úÖ Model loaded successfully!")

## 3\. Upload Your Images üñºÔ∏è

Run this cell to upload the two images you want to fuse. An "upload" button will appear.

  * **Image 1 (Style Image):** This image will provide the initial structure and composition for the new artwork.
  * **Image 2 (Content Image):** While not directly used as a second input image in this pipeline, its concepts should be described in your prompt. The AI will fuse the *idea* of this image with the structure of the first one.

<!-- end list -->

from google.colab import files

print("Please upload your first image (the base/style image)...")
uploaded_style = files.upload()

if uploaded_style:
    style_image_name = next(iter(uploaded_style))
    print(f"\nUploaded '{style_image_name}' as the style image.")
else:
    print("No style image was uploaded.")

## 4\. Generate Your AI Art ‚ú®

This is the final step where the magic happens.

1.  **Define your prompt:** Clearly describe the final image you want. Mention elements from both of your uploaded images and add "Full Length Body Size View" to ensure the framing is correct.
2.  **Run the cell:** The AI will use your first image as a base and transform it according to your prompt, generating a new piece of art in the specified 9:16 aspect ratio.

<!-- end list -->

# --- Your Settings ---
prompt = "A fusion of the two images, a surreal portrait of a knight wearing a floral helmet, cinematic lighting, dramatic, Full Length Body Size View"

# --- Image Generation ---
if uploaded_style:
    # Open the uploaded image
    init_image = Image.open(BytesIO(uploaded_style[style_image_name])).convert("RGB")

    # Define the 9:16 aspect ratio dimensions
    # These are standard resolutions for this ratio
    width = 576
    height = 1024

    # Resize the initial image to match the target output dimensions
    init_image = init_image.resize((width, height))

    print("‚è≥ Generating your image... this may take a moment.")

    # Generate the image
    # 'strength' controls how much the original image is changed (0.0-1.0)
    # 'guidance_scale' controls how closely the prompt is followed (higher is stricter)
    generator = torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(1024) # for reproducible results
    image = pipe(
        prompt=prompt,
        image=init_image,
        strength=0.75,
        guidance_scale=7.5,
        generator=generator
    ).images[0]

    print("\nüéâ Generation complete! Here is your fused artwork:")
    display(image)

else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Please upload a style image in the previous cell before running this one.")
